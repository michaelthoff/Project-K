# Project-K
Contains all folders, files, and information relevant to the development of practice and learning, short of creating a first functional prototype or beta

For the sake of instilling and mastering good version-control practices, all software in Project-K will be outfitted with appropriate suite testing. Testing will be compliant with the following version history convention: [major features].[minor features].[bug fixes], where minor features and bug fixes must be backwards-compatible. Ergo, if an API-interfacing test must be re-written as a result of any change to the underlying software, the major version number must be incremented.
